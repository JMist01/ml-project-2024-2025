## Evolutionary Dynamics of Multi-Agent Learning: A Survey
- Understaning replicator dynamics and veryfing corectness of plots. (2.4, 3.1,5(fig. 6),6.1 (fig. 8) )
- Also it explains Bolrtzmann learsning. (2.1)
- Nash equilibrai (2.3)

## A Comprehensive Survey of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning
- boltzmann q learning (1.A)
- greeedy q learning (1.A)

## Lenient Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Palmer at al. 2018)
- NOTE: not really from the assignment
- what is lenient  learning (3.Leniency)
